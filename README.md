# **WayWise - Documentation**

## **1. Overview and Architecture**

The Itinerary Generator is a full-stack application designed to provide users with personalized travel itineraries based on their preferences, budget, and travel dates. The architecture consists of three primary components: the **frontend**, the **backend**, and Firebase services. These components interact with external APIs (like OpenTripMap) to fetch data and provide user-specific results, which are stored securely in Firestore for logged-in users. Here's a breakdown of the overall architecture:

-   **Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Firebase + Leaflet):**
    -   Handles user interaction, including login and itinerary generation.
    -   Presents a map-based interface where users can visualize their itinerary and destinations.
    -   Sends requests to the backend for itinerary generation and interacts with Firebase services to store/retrieve user data.
-   **Backend (Next.js API Routes):**

    -   Serves as the core logic for itinerary generation.
    -   Interacts with external APIs (OpenTripMap) to fetch data on destinations.
    -   Processes user inputs to create a detailed itinerary and stores it in Firestore for logged-in users.

-   **External APIs (OpenTripMap):**

    -   Used to gather information about destinations, attractions, and activities based on user preferences.
    -   Supports fetching of activities, transportation data, and calculating total travel distance.

-   **Firebase Services (Authentication + Firestore):**
    -   **Firebase Authentication** (Google OAuth) manages user login and authentication.
    -   **Firestore** stores user-specific itineraries, allowing users to retrieve and view previously generated itineraries.

## **2. Key Technologies and Decisions**

### **Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript + Firebase + Leaflet**

-   **Next.js (App Router):** Provides server-side rendering and API routes that allow for a scalable, modern web application. The new App Router structure simplifies routing and backend integration in a React framework.
-   **TypeScript:** Using TypeScript ensures type safety, especially when dealing with complex API responses, coordinates, and other dynamic data. It reduces runtime errors and improves maintainability.

-   **Firebase Client SDK (Authentication + Firestore):**
    -   Firebase Authentication is used to implement **Google OAuth** for easy user sign-in.
    -   Firestore stores user-generated itineraries, allowing users to persist and access their data across sessions.
-   **Leaflet (React-Leaflet):** Leaflet is an open-source library for map rendering. It integrates well with React through React-Leaflet, allowing dynamic rendering of maps and markers to display travel destinations.

### **Backend: Next.js API Routes**

-   **Next.js API Routes** handle requests for itinerary generation and interacting with third-party APIs like OpenTripMap. These server-side functions handle the processing logic before sending data back to the frontend or storing it in Firestore.

### **Key Justifications for These Technologies**

-   **Next.js + TypeScript** provides a strong framework for server-side rendering and building scalable web apps with typed safety. The App Router improves backend/frontend interaction.
-   **Firebase Authentication & Firestore** simplify user authentication and provide a secure, scalable, and easy-to-manage database for storing user itineraries.
-   **Leaflet** was selected for its lightweight nature and ability to seamlessly handle geographic data, providing an efficient way to display travel destinations.
-   **OpenTripMap** API provides detailed tourist information for destinations, enhancing itinerary generation.

## **3. Frontend Implementation**

### **React Components**

-   **MapComponent:**  
    The core map visualization logic is implemented using `react-leaflet`. It dynamically places markers for each destination based on latitude and longitude coordinates and uses the `fitBounds` function to auto-adjust the zoom to display all destinations within view.

-   **FormComponent:**  
    A form allows users to input their destination, travel dates, budget, and preferences. Upon submission, the form data is sent to the backend for itinerary generation.

-   **LoginPage (auth/login):**  
    Implements Firebase Google OAuth login with a button to allow users to sign in using their Google account.

-   **DashboardPage (/dashboard):**  
    After logging in, users are redirected to the dashboard, which displays their previously generated itineraries. The dashboard integrates with **Daisy UI** components for a clean, responsive interface.

-   **SignOutButton:**  
    Provides the ability to log out from Firebase. Users can sign out via a simple button on the dashboard page.

-   **Google OAuth Login:**  
    Using Firebase Authentication, users can sign in using their Google account, ensuring a seamless login experience.

-   **Firestore Integration:**  
    Once logged in, users' generated itineraries are saved to Firestore, allowing them to view previous itineraries upon returning to the app. Itineraries are saved under their unique user ID.

### **Challenges on the Frontend**

-   **Handling Invalid Coordinates:**  
    When the OpenTripMap API returns empty or invalid data, fallback logic was implemented to avoid rendering faulty markers on the map. This ensures a smooth user experience with valid data.

-   **Dynamic Map Zoom:**  
    Using Leaflet's `fitBounds` method to automatically adjust the zoom level to fit all destination markers on the map solved the challenge of users manually adjusting the zoom.

## **4. Backend Implementation**

### **Next.js API Routes**

The backend is implemented as server-side functions in Next.js using API routes. These routes handle interactions with OpenTripMap to fetch activities and generate itineraries.

1. **Itinerary Generation API:**  
   This endpoint takes the user's input (destination, dates, budget, preferences), interacts with OpenTripMap, and returns a detailed itinerary.

2. **Firestore Integration:**  
   When a user is logged in, the generated itinerary is saved to Firestore under their unique user ID.

### **Key Functions**

-   **`get_location_coordinates`:** Fetches latitude and longitude for a given location.
-   **`get_activities_from_opentripmap`:** Fetches activities based on user preferences (e.g., historical, museums, restaurants).
-   **`calculate_transport_cost`:** Uses the Haversine formula to compute distances between destinations and calculate transport costs.

### **Challenges on the Backend**

-   **Handling Empty API Responses:**  
    OpenTripMap occasionally returns no results or empty arrays. Logic was implemented to handle these cases by skipping invalid entries, ensuring the itinerary generation process continues smoothly.

-   **Firebase Data Storage:**  
    Storing and retrieving itineraries for specific users required efficient integration with Firebase Firestore, ensuring that only authenticated users could access their data.

## **5. Interesting Nuances and Challenges**

-   **Google OAuth Integration:**  
    Implementing Firebase Google OAuth was straightforward, but ensuring that the authentication state persisted correctly across all pages required global state management via context.

-   **Dynamic Map Rendering:**  
    Leafletâ€™s ability to handle dynamic zoom based on marker coordinates was leveraged to ensure the user could always see all destinations. This improved the overall user experience, especially on mobile devices.

-   **Efficient API Calls:**  
    Since itinerary generation relies on multiple API calls to OpenTripMap, rate-limiting and proper error handling were implemented to ensure API calls did not fail, even under load.

---

## **6. Potential Improvements**

1. **Improve Itinerary Customization:**  
   Allow users to have more control over itinerary preferences, such as duration of stay at each destination, types of restaurants, and more specific filters (e.g., nightlife, adventure activities).

2. **Caching API Responses:**  
   Implementing caching mechanisms would reduce the number of API calls made to OpenTripMap, improving performance and reducing load times for commonly requested locations.

3. **Multi-Provider Authentication:**  
   While Google OAuth is integrated, adding additional authentication providers (e.g., Facebook, GitHub) would give users more flexibility in how they log in.

4. **Progressive Web App (PWA):**  
   Converting the app into a PWA would allow users to access itineraries offline, enhancing usability while traveling in areas with limited connectivity.
